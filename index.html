            <p>Kandhkot, the district headquarters of Kashmore, is an old city on the right side of the Indus River, with a history rooted in the Kalhora Dynasty and later under the Talpur Mirs. It's a gateway to Punjab and Balochistan and its history is intertwined with the Indus River and the development of irrigation infrastructure. 
                Here's a more detailed look at Kandhkot's history:
                Early History: The Kalhora Dynasty established a fort in Kandhkot during their waning years. 
                Talpur Rule: After the Kalhoras, the area came under the control of the Talpur Mirs, who ruled until 1841 when Khangarh (now Jacobabad) was handed over to the East India Company through a treaty. 
                Small Village: During that time, Kandhkot was a small village with a population of about 100 people. 
                Name Origin: While the name "Kandhkot" is often thought to mean "the city on the bank of a river," this interpretation is a fabrication, according to Ardo Urtradi, a Sindhi writer and historian. 
                Kashmore District Headquarters: Kandhkot serves as the district headquarters of Kashmore. 
                Gateway to Punjab and Balochistan: Kashmore City, including Kandhkot, is a gateway to Punjab and Balochistan. 
                Indus River Significance: The city's main electricity comes from the Indus River. 
                Guddu Barrage: Kashmore is the site of the first mega-irrigation structure over the Indus, Guddu Barrage, which is the head of the irrigation system within Sindh. 
                Water Issues: The people of Kashmore have decried the non-availability of water in Guddu barrage's right canals, attributing it to unfair interprovincial water distribution by the Indus River System Authority (Irsa). </p>
