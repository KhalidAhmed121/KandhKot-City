        <p>Kandhkot City Park is a small but very beautiful green area situated in the central part in the city of Kandhkot, Kashmore district in the province of Sindh in Pakistan. The park was established quite long ago but is a very popular
             <br>place to spend free time, especially with local children. One can enter the park through a tall gate and pass by a small state of elephants.
             <br>There are plenty of playgrounds, a lot of space to sit on the grasses and enjoy a warm day, facilities for sports, located on an interesting natural setting. There are palm trees and a large variety of other tropical tress in the park.
             <br>The place is usually quite crowded but all of the visitors have great time and spend at least 2 hours there.</p>
